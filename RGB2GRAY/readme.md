Homework 1
Color to Greyscale Conversion

A common way to represent color images is known as RGBA - the color is specified by how much Red, Green, and Blue is in it.
The 'A' stands for Alpha and is used for transparency; it will be ignored in this homework.

Each channel Red, Blue, Green, and Alpha is represented by one byte. Since we are using one byte for each color there are 256 different
possible values for each color.  This means we use 4 bytes per pixel.

Greyscale images are represented by a single intensity value per pixel which is one byte in size.

To convert an image from color to grayscale one simple method is to set the intensity to the average of the RGB channels.  But we will
use a more sophisticated method that takes into account how the eye perceives color and weights the channels unequally.

The eye responds most strongly to green followed by red and then blue. The NTSC (National Television System Committee) recommends the following
formula for color to greyscale conversion:

I = .299f * R + .587f * G + .114f * B

Notice the trailing f's on the numbers which indicate that they are single precision floating point constants and not double precision constants.
